#### DATA DESCRIPTION ####
'''
directory.id	Id assigned to imaging directories. Not from LONi data
Subject (PTID)	Participant ID
RID	Participant roster ID
Image.Data.ID	MRI ID
Modality	Image type
Visit	1=screening scan
Acq.Date	MRI date
DX.bl	Diagnosis at baseline
EXAMDATE	Examination Date
AGE	Age at baseline
PTGENDER	Sex
PTEDUCAT	Years of Education
PTETHCAT	Ethnicity
PTRACCAT	Race
APOE4	APOE4 genotype
MMSE	MMSE score
imputed_genotype	Challenge specific designation, TRUE=has imputed genotypes
APOE Genotype	APOE allele 1 and allele 2 genotypes
Dx Codes for Submission	The LMCI in the ADNI data is equivalent to MCI in test. This column just converts LMCI->MCI

#For example, it is much worse to diagnose someone as Cognitively Normal (CN) when in fact they have Alheimer's (AD) than it is
#to diagnose someone as Limited Mild Cognitively Impaired (LMCI) when they are Cognitively Normal (CN), along with many other cases.

#On incorrect predictions, predicted CN too often (~50% of the time) where CN was <10% of the actual correct labels for
#observations incorrectly predicted. Can be viewed as a False Negative and would be very bad to predict CN when a patient 
#has LMCI or AD. 

#Distribution of incorrect predictions: 48% CN, 40% LMCI, 12% AD
#Distribution of labels on incorrect predictions: 8% CN, 60% LMCI, 30% AD

#Main problem: False Negatives. Predicting CN and under-predicting LMCI and AD.
